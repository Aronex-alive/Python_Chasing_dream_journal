Today I had a Physics Exam, and i am currently learning cyber security from coursera although I am waiting for my financial aid apllilication to be granted, so that I can start learning python. I will be posting all my daily progress and learnings at this platform. Today being the first day let's keep it short and also I have a aim/dream which I want to achieve
I will be dedicated towards that dream for sure. IN the later parts i will talk about it.
